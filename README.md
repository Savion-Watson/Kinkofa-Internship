# Black Cemeteries SEO Code 
During my internship at Kinkofa, I was told the company was need of more users to fund future projects, but lacked a strong online presence.  
They requested a programmatic SEO page made in Webflow that archived historically Black cemeteries and demonstrated the functionality of a future app: Black Cemeteries.  

_See the page here: https://kinkofa-2024.webflow.io/_

To create more dynamic functionality and work around Webflow's limitations, I created many custom HTML and JavaScript component such as... 
* Color-changing tags 
* Image galleries 
* Customized headers based on current data 
* Data search functionality through a form (depreciated)

I also wrote Python code to categorize our existing data into additional SEO-friendly files to make it easier for users to find cemeteries. This ensured... 
* Lossy data (i.e. states with the same county/city names, entries with no county or city) was properly categorized with only the most similar data
* A maximized SEO potential by with relevant links and headers 


## Actions 
To complete this project I...
* Reviewed and edited the Product Requirement Document for the original application
* Drafted the pages and their designs in Figma to gauge feedback from staff 
* Created each webpage from scratch based on designs.
* Ensured the pages were responsive by adjusting layouts and styles on each breakpoint
* Helped the back-end staff clean data and suggested additional fields to maximize SEO potential 
* Worked around engine limitations by embedding custom components made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript such as 
* Meet with staff and other interns on a weekly basis to garner feedback 
* Quickly found fixes for bugs using online documentation and own experimentation 
* Clearly communicated potential issues the project had with staff and discussed pragmatic solutions 


## Impact 
Once the page was finished, I was able to archive... 
* 200+ cemeteries 
* 100+ cities 
* 60+ Counties  

In addition I was able to... 
* Made categorical pages comparable to competitors such as Findagrave.com and Familysearch.com
* Preserve cemetery data that would have been lost from aging websites 
* Save Kinkofa money with custom components that would have been spent on 3rd party add-ons
