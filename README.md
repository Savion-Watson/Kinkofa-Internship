During my internship at kinkofa, I focused on enhancing the company's online presence to attract more users. To achieve this, I developed programmatic SEO pages in Webflow that archives historically Black cemeteries and demonstrates the functionality of kinkofa’s forthcoming app: Black Cemeteries.

## Objectives 

Kinkofa aimed to... 
* Build topical authority in Black history and genealogy
* Increase brand awareness
* Migrate the site to Webflow for better content management
* Improve user experience (UX)
* Strengthen web presence through programmatic SEO
* Save historic Black cemetery data from link rot so that family researchers can find information about their ancestors.


To create more dynamic functionality and work around Webflow's limitations, I created many custom HTML and JavaScript component such as... 
* Color-changing tags 
* Image galleries 
* Customized headers based on current data 
* Data search functionality through a form (depreciated)

I also wrote Python code to categorize our existing data into additional SEO-friendly files to make it easier for users to find cemeteries. This ensured... 
* Lossy data (i.e. states with the same county/city names, entries with no county or city) was properly categorized with only the most similar data
* A maximized SEO potential by with relevant links and headers 


## Actions 
To complete this project I...
* Reviewed and edited the Product Requirement Document for the original application
* Drafted pages and designs in Figma to pitch to the leadership team for feedback and approval.**
* Created each webpage from scratch based on designs.
* Ensured the pages were responsive by adjusting layouts and styles on each breakpoint
* Assisted back-end staff in cleaning data and proposed additional fields to maximize SEO potential.
* Helped the back-end staff clean data and suggested additional fields to maximize SEO potential 
* Embedded custom components made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to work around engine limitations.
* Met with staff and other interns on a weekly basis to garner feedback 
* Quickly found fixes for bugs using online documentation and own experimentation 
* Clearly communicated potential issues the project had with staff and discussed pragmatic solutions 


## Impact 
Once the page was finished, I was able to archive... 
* 200+ cemeteries 
* 100+ cities 
* 60+ Counties  

Additionally I ...
* Developed and implemented a full-stack programmatic SEO solution within Webflow, optimizing user experience and improving brand visibility.
* Created categorical pages comparable to competitors like Findagrave.com and Familysearch.com.
* Custom-built and integrated multiple components using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, enhancing the site’s functionality beyond Webflow's native capabilities.
* Wrote Python scripts for data categorization, improving SEO optimization and ensuring data integrity.
* Saved Kinkofa approximately 187.5-281.25 hours of development time, translating to an estimated $9,375-$14,062.5 in development costs.
* Avoided spending approximately $2,250 on third-party tools by building custom components.
* Preserved historical data from link rot, enabling Black families and researchers to access valuable ancestral information.
* Created and documented a SQL database to store genealogy data, ensuring interoperability between the firm’s apps and determined the design of the SEO pages
* Informed the Back-End team on how to efficiently scrape websites and connect existing data to the new PPE system
