# Black Cemeteries SEO Code 
During my internship at Kinkofa, I was told the company was need of more users to fund future projects, but lacked a strong online presence.  
They requested a programmatic SEO page made in Webflow that archived historically Black cemeteries and demonstrated the functionality of a future app: Black Cemeteries.  

_See the page here: https://blackcemeteries.kinkofa.com/_

To create more dynamic functionality and work around Webflow's limitations, I created many custom HTML and JavaScript component such as... 
* Color-changing tags 
* Image galleries 
* Customized headers based on current data 
* Data search functionality through a form (depreciated)

I also wrote Python code to categorize our existing data into additional SEO-friendly files to make it easier for users to find cemeteries. This ensured... 
* Lossy data (i.e. states with the same county/city names, entries with no county or city) was properly categorized with only the most similar data
* A maximized SEO potential by with relevant links and headers 


## Actions 
To complete this project I...
* Reviewed and edited the Product Requirement Document for the original application
* Drafted the pages and their designs in Figma to gauge feedback from staff 
* Created each webpage from scratch based on designs.
* Ensured the pages were responsive by adjusting layouts and styles on each breakpoint
* Assisted back-end staff in cleaning data and proposed additional fields to maximize SEO potential.
* Helped the back-end staff clean data and suggested additional fields to maximize SEO potential 
* Worked around engine limitations by embedding custom components made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript such as 
* Meet with staff and other interns on a weekly basis to garner feedback 
* Quickly found fixes for bugs using online documentation and own experimentation 
* Clearly communicated potential issues the project had with staff and discussed pragmatic solutions 


## Impact 
Once the page was finished, I was able to archive... 
* 200+ cemeteries 
* 100+ cities 
* 60+ Counties  

Additionally I ...
* Created categorical pages comparable to competitors like Findagrave.com and Familysearch.com.
* Preserved cemetery data that might have been lost from aging websites. (Protected valuable historical data from link rot, ensuring that future generations of Black families and researchers can access this information.)
* Saved Kinkofa approximately 187.5-281.25 hours of development time, translating to an estimated $9,375-$14,062.5 in development costs.
* Avoided spending approximately $2,250 on third-party tools by building custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components.
